# install-developer.sh: Install bknix to a profile folder (*loco*)

(*This assumes that you have already [met the basic requirements](requirements.md).*)

The `install-developer.sh` script is optimized for a personal developer workstation (e.g.  macOS or Ubuntu).
It's tuned for the following assumptions:

* You are likely to need *periodic access* to different permutations of PHP, MySQL, etc. This allows one to investigate
  bug-reports that are version-specific.
* You don't need to *concurrently* use all services (php70+php71+php72+mysql54+mysql57+mysql80 ad nauseum).
  Supporting this would add complexity (more port-numbers, host-names, config-files, etc) and increase 
  resource-utilization.
* You need to integrate *third-party tooling* - such as an IDE - with the chosen environment. This requires
  having a stable set of file locations.


## Quick Version

This document can be summarized as two steps:

```
me@localhost:~$ git clone https://github.com/totten/bknix ~/bknix
me@localhost:~$ cd ~/bknix
me@localhost:~$ env PROFILES="dfl" ./bin/install-developer.sh
me@localhost:~$ use-bknix dfl -s
```

The rest of this document explains these steps in more depth.  If you
already understand them, then proceed to [bknix: General usage](usage-loco.md).

## Download configuration

First, we need to get a copy of the `bknix` specification. This provides configuration files which list
the various packages/programs, and it provides some helper scripts to make use of them.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/totten/bknix ~/bknix
```

## Download and install binaries

Second, we download and install the actual binaries.  For example, this will install the `dfl` profile in
`/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/$USER/bknix-dfl`:

```
env PROFILES="dfl" ./bin/install-developer.sh
```

> __TIP__: The environment variables `PROFILES` optionally specifies a space-delimited list of profiles.  If you run
> `install-developer.sh` without specifying the profiles, it will use `min max dfl`.

The `install-developer.sh` script will:

* Install binaries for each profile in a predictable location: `/nix/var/nix/profiles/...`
  (*This feels a bit like installing an application under `/opt/<foo>` except that the actual path is `/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/$USER/bknix-$PROFILE`.*)
* Install a helper command, `use-bknix`, which facilitates access to these binaries.
  (*This feels a bit like using `nix-shell` or `docker exec`.*)
* Install a helper command, `loco run`, which will start and stop services.

Once it's finished, you can inspect the list of binaries that were installed.  The `bin` folder contains symlinks for
all of the downloaded software.

```

## Environment

After downloading, the programs are available in `/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/$USER/bknix-dfl`, but they're not ready to use on the command line.

You need to setup the environment. The helper script `use-bknix` will do this, as in:

```
use-bknix dfl -s
```

In the example below, observe how we get access to a new version of `php`:

```
me@localhost:~/bknix$ which php
/usr/bin/php
me@localhost:~/bknix$ use-bknix dfl -s
[bknix-dfl:~/bknix] which php
/nix/var/nix/profiles/bknix-dfl/bin/php
```

Once we know how to open a shell with a well-configured environment, we can proceed to [bknix: General usage](usage-loco.md).

## TIP: IDEs and Environments

If you use a graphical IDE, you should be able to view and edit code without any special work.  However, if you want to
use the Nice Stuff (such as debugging), then the IDE needs to have the same environment configuration.  The details
will depend a lot on your how the IDE and OS's graphical-shell work. Here are a few approaches to consider:

* The primary job of `use-bknix` is to set environment variables. You can use it in a couple ways:
    * `use-bknix <PROFILE> -s`: This starts a new sub-shell and sets up the environment. If you type `exit`, it will go back to your original shell.
    * `eval $( use-bknix <PROFILE> )`: This keeps your existing shell and updates all the required environment variables.
* In some platforms, the OS's graphical-shell might respect `~/.profile`. If you want to always `bknix` available, you could edit the profile script and add `eval $( use-bknix <PROFILE> )`
* In some platforms, the OS's graphical-shell might have a similar-but-different file (like `.xsession` or `.xinitrc`?).
* In some platforms, the OS's graphical-shell might let you use a custom launch command -- have it setup the environment and then run the IDE.
* In some platforms, the OS's graphical-shell might give explicit options for managing the environment of each program. Use this to add `PATH` (and all the other variables from `bknix env`).
* In some platforms, the IDE might have its own settings for manipulating the environment and registering tools and paths.
