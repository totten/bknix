# This installs each of the bknix profiles in a way that's useful for a developer's workstation.
# Specifically:
#   - If not previously done, install nix and cachix
#   - Install the binaries for each profile in /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/$USER/bknix-$PROFILE
#   - Don't do anything about data; this will be done at the developer's discretion
#
# Pre-requisites:
#   Use a Debian-like main OS
#   Install the "nix" package manager.
#   Only tested with multiuser mode.
#   Login as proper root (e.g. `sudo -i bash`)
#
# Example: Install (or upgrade) the most common profiles
#   ./bin/install-developer.sh
#
# Example: Install (or upgrade) specific profiles
#   PROFILES='min max old edge dfl' ./bin/install-developer.sh
#
# After installation, an automated script can use a statement like:
#    eval $(use-bknix min)
#    eval $(use-bknix max)
#    eval $(use-bknix dfl)
