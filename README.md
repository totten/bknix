`bknix` is a highly opinionated environment for developing in PHP/JS -- esp for developing patches/add-ons for CiviCRM.

This branch is undergoing an incremental reorganization to change the process-management component.
There are two variants of the README:

* [README.legacy.md](README.legacy.md) (tuned for the older process-management)
* [README.loco.md](README.loco.md) (tuned for the newer process-management)
